# Brain-Tumour-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
This is my M.Tech project which is part of the subject introduction to deep learning. The goal of this project is to leverage the maximum power of pre-trained models like ResNet (Residual Network) and its variants, Xception for the classification of existence of brain tumour.
